# Phase 3 Project Backend: Alabama's Best Music Festivals ðŸ¤ 


## Overview

We ain't got much in Alabama, but we do got some good music festivals! ðŸ¤  :cowboy_hat_face: In this app, I list out some of the best music festivals we have to offer including their official name, city, the month they occur (dates often vary), and their website.

Are we missing any? You're fully free to add your own and add a review. You can even review the existing ones!

Did you make a typo? No worries! You can edit a review. Or maybe you changed your mind :)

## Backend Setup

To install all dependencies and seed the data included, please follow the steps below.

To set up your backend, first run
```console
$ bundle install
```
then run 
```console
$ bundle exec rake db:migrate db:seed
```
lastly, 
```console
$ bundle exec rake server
```

The backend is now set up! Please head to the [front end](https://github.com/brantae/project-3-frontend) to run the application.

## Stretch Goals

It is pretty basic for now. Plans for images, headliners, dark/light mode, and more will be in the works!
